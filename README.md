This folder contains the following items: the Raw Employment Data, both an ipynb and a html file containing code for cleaning and prepping my raw data for merge, a final xlsx file of my clean, revised data and this read me file. These files represent and show the full process of uploading cleaning and exporting raw data to be merged with other data sets. Ultimately, this data will be merged and analysed.
